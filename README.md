TODO, I'm not very sure right now.

## Small note

If this little thing helped with your modding, if would be very nice if you would credit me.
For example, you can put my pseudonym (Dobby233Liu) in your mod's credits file / in-game credits sequence, the mod's description on its hosting sites etc.

## Development setup
