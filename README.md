# CastleTownRecreation

A (kinda partial) recreation of the whole Castle Town area in Deltarune Ch2 for [Kristal](https://github.com/KristalTeam/Kristal), a Deltarune fangame engine.

## Installation

TODO! I'm not really sure right now. This is currently packaged in the form of a normal mod, so you can probably copy files over.
Since you will absolutely need to edit the maps to a certain degree, I don't think packaging this as a library will be a good choice.

## Small note

If this little thing helped with your modding, it would be very nice if you would credit me.
For example, you can put my pseudonym (Dobby233Liu) in your mod's credits file / in-game credits sequence, the mod's description on its hosting sites etc.

## Development setup

```
git clone https://github.com/Dobby233Liu/CastleTownRecreation.git path/to/mods/castle_town
```
